#### How to Contribute

Thank you for considering contributing to the development of open and transparent 
FICAM guidance documents. To contribute to this site, please leverage the information provided below, and visit the GitHub repository which houses the source files for the site and exists [here]({{site.github.repository_url}}/{{site.branch}}/). If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue under the 'Issues' tab of the repository. Please note that opening issues or adding content to the repository will require the creation of a GitHub account.

GitHub issues are the primary way of sharing information and discussing this site with the broader community. For example, they should be used for:

* _Suggestions:_ You would like to suggest an edit or addition to any existing pages or information on this site
* _Corrections:_ You have identified a problem with existing information on the site and would like to discuss a correction
* _Pages:_ You have identified a topic for a new guidance document that is not yet on the site that would be beneficial to the playbook

Each issue that you open should be named to clearly align with its primary topic, and tracked so that you can discuss the issue with other contributors and follow any updates. All suggestions and corrections should be stated clearly, with any links or other relevant information included in the issue.

If you would like to contribute to a specific playbook, you should navigate to the Contribute page of that playbook for further directions.

#### Plain Language
Contributors should consider the audience when submitting content. Plain language benefits a broad audience. Review your proposed content for use of acronyms and specialized jargon before submitting.

####  Thanks
