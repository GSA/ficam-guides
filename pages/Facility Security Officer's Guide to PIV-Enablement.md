###Facility Security Officer's Guide to PIV-Enablement

####Introduction
The purpose of this playbook is to provide you, a Facility Security Officer, an
 overview of how to bring your facility in compliance with Homeland Security 
 Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 has was published in August 2004.  Its intent 
 was to establish a common set of policies for creating "secure and reliable" forms 
 of identification for government employees and contractors.  
 
 It will not be a substitute for becoming familiar with the publications we have referenced here, but it
 should give you a general idea of what will be involved.

The first two sections of this playbook are based on [the most recent Risk 
Management Guideline from ISC](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ISC_Risk-Management-Process_Aug_2013.pdf).  Note that nowhere in this publication is "PIV" mentioned.  That's because this document covers the entire realm of physical security, and PIV is only a part of the overall picture.  

The next sections discuss how PIV cards can enhance the physical security of 
the facility.

Finally, we discuss the procurement process.

####1. Create a Facility Security Committee

If your facility has no _Facility Security Committee_, _Appendix D: How to 
Conduct a Facility Security Committee_, explains the purpose, makeup, and 
function of the _Facility Security Committee_ (FSC). It discusses...

####2. Know your security requirements.  
  * Determine your facility's risk level.  
 
     _Section 4_ provides tables that help you "score" your facility in terms 
     of 5 equally-weighted security factors:  
 
       * Mission Criticality
       * Symbolism
       * Facility Population
       * Facility Size
       * Threat to Tenant Agencies

   Your score is a called the _Facility Security Level_ (or FSL).  The rationale 
   for the security factors are explained later in _Section 4_ if you are unsure as to what the factors mean.

   You may need to consider intangible factors as to whether you should raise or 
   lower your FSL.  An example cited is the duration of occupancy. Or, if your facility is a one-of-a-kind, i.e., there are no other government facilites that perform the function that yours does, then it may very well be deemed as a _Very High_ FSL due to its criticality factor.  _Section 4.5_ contains guidance for determining whether your site meets that level.  

   * Determine your facility's countermeasures.

     _Section 5_ provides guidance for creating:  
     * an application of baseline _Level of Protection_ (LOP) for your site,
     * or a customized LOP based on facility-specific conditions.

    If you haven't done so already, you'll need to request a copy of _Appendix 
    B - Countermeasures_ from [Office of the Interagency Security 
    Committee](mailto:ISCAccess@DHS.gov\?subject=Request for Appendix B - 
    Countermeasures).  Using this, complete the risk management process which is 
    depicted in the _Risk Management Process_ flowchart in _Figure 1_.  The 
    flowchart helps you to identify assets and risks and to adjust levels of 
    protection for your facility that meet those risks.

####3. Learn What PIV Countermeasures are Available.

TODO: Here is where we introduce SP 800-116 and summarize _Section 6: PACS Use Cases_.

####4. Prepare a Migration Plan
TODO: Here is where we talk about _Section 7: Migration strategy_.
* Selecting authentication mechanisms
* Identify technology gaps
* Select the appropriate solution
* Select a target PIV Implementation Maturity Model

####5. Get your FSC On-board
After providing the achievable levels of protection and the residual risks to 
the stakeholders on the FSC, you may or may not implement the countermeasures 
you found in _Section 5_.  The decision will be based upon the FSC 
stakeholders' willingness to accept the risks you identified and available 
budget.  The remaining risks after an agreed-upon set of countermeasures is 
decided, will be documented.
