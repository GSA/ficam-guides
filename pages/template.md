title: Guidance Document Template
permalink: /template/
---
This page serves as the template for creating your own guidance document to add to one of the FICAM Playbooks. For an example of a completed guidance document, visit the 'How do I PIV enable my network logon?' page [here]({{site.piv_playbook_gh_url}}/devconfig/15_network/). To create your own page, copy this file, save it with a new name (such as mypage.md instead of template.md, as you should not save your information within the template.md file), and change the title and permalink in the top section of this file. The title should be what you want to appear at the top of the page on the site, and the permalink text should match the name of the file, but in the format /mypage/ instead of mypage.md. Throughout this file, you will see text that explains how to correctly use this template and comments explaining the nature of the code that you will encounter.

<!--- For example, this code denotes a comment, and information written inside of it will not appear on the website but can be used as a reference for others viewing the file. -->

<!--- The code below allows for the use of an 'accordion' on the page, which collapses or shows text when you click on a section of it. This code should not be removed from the file. -->
<script>
$(function() {
  $( "#accordion" ).accordion({
    heightStyle: "content",
    collapsible: "true",
    active: "false"
  });
});
</script>

<!--- The code below creates a difficulty identifier on the page, which can either be Beginner, Moderate, or Advanced depending on the technical knowledge required to complete the procedure. The example below includes text that mark the document as 'Advanced', this string can be changed as needed.-->
<div style="float:right; padding:10px; margin-right:20px; border-radius:10px; width:180px; height:40px; box-shadow:3px 3px 5px 0px; text-align:center; background-color:#CCC; color:#666666">
<div style="color:#000000">
<em>Difficulty: Advanced</em>
</div>
</div>

<!--- The '#' symbol is used to denote headers, with different amounts aligning with different header styles. -->
#### Overview

<!--- The code below triggers the start of the accordion dropdown for the main steps of the guidance document. Leave this in place if you wish to use the accordion layout. -->
<div id="accordion" markdown="1">

<!-- Each accordion section will be formatted such that:
	the title is the text following the ###
	and the body of the accordion is wihin the <div></div> tags. -->

### 1. Title of Procedure 1
<div markdown="1">

> This text will appear as a 'warning flag' on the website, which is a yellow banner. (The ">" symbol and the line directly underneath this body of text create the formatting for this flag.) Warning flags can be used for notifications such as notifying a user that they should skip a certain procedure.
{:class="warning"}

> This text will appear as a red banner, for an 'alert' message. Alert flags can be used for notifications such as common problems that may occur.
{:class="alert"}

> This text will appear as a green banner, for an 'informational' message. These flags can be used for notifications such as useful links or helpful tips. 
{:class="info"}

This is the main body text that explains the purpose of the procedure and any context that you might need before diving into the individual steps. The text within each step should walk the user directly through exactly what they need to do to complete the procedure. **Text within double asterisks will appear as bolded.** *Text within single asterisks will appear as italicized.* For more information on formatting in markdown, go [here.](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
